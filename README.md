# Line Follower with Arduino and Alphabot

Project is focused on building and programming Line Follower robot as semester project.

### Prerequisites

#### Prior knowledge 

Participants are welcome to have prior experience in C/C++ programming and High School physics, however it's not required.

#### Software and hardware

For efficient partaking you need to have an access to PC or Mac computer with either MS Windows, MAC OS or Linux installed. Arduino development environment is fine to run on all mainstream platforms. To modify or install Android application you need to Android Studio. Application is helpful for experimenting and setting proper values for PID control.

Follow the link to install appropriate version of Arduino IDE on your computer: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
